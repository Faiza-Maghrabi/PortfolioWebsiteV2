                    <h2>-------------------------------------</h2>
                    <p>In this module, I utilised the skills I had learnt previously in my GCSE and A Level, here I also learnt how to harcode a form/interface using Java and libraries like AWT and SWING.
                        For my miniproject at the end of the module, I created a clicker game where the player clicks a button to cause varying amount of damage to a monster, defeating them will result in a increase in money. Players can then use this to buy new weapons and deal more damage.

                    <p>Here, I learnt a completely new language and techniques to help me create my own portfolio website. The languages I was taught included HTML, CSS, HP, and JS. I also challenged myself to create a complicated filter and sort system that updates and grows as new entries are created and input into the blog. I used my previous SQL knowledge in maintaining a database for my blog entries (seen in a dynamic version of this site.) The rest of the module consisted of multiple code checks to make sure my techniques were of high quality and I strove to meet all the criteria given to me.</p>

                    <p>In this module I made good use of my problem solving skills and learn how to draw, solve and evaluate FSA graphs as well as its other forms. This marking for this module consisted of multiple labs as well as an exam and I made sure to complete those as swiftly as possible. This module was challenging, but I was able to persevere and received high makrs for my work in the end.</p>

                    <p>This module worked as a supplementary to the OOP module and taught how you organise and structure programs with polymorphism. It consisted of two sets of coursework that I was able to complete in good time - utilising my time management skills.</p>

                    <h2>Year 1 Semester A - ECS401U Procedural Programming</h2>
                    <h2>-------------------------------------</h2>
                    <p>Whilst learning procedural programming, I grew my organisation skills are I had to balance finishing multiple lab tasks with a large mini-project. I went over code concepts that I was familiar with before and learned how to adapt them to the java programming language. Lab exercises on visual studio, as well as their document counterparts, took time to create but I persevered and was able to complete every lab exercise available – this includes the difficult recursive task. Despite how difficult it seemed, I displayed drive and motivation by persevering through it.
                        For my mini-project, I demonstrated creativity and problem solving as I thought of and implemented many coding subroutines to fulfil my criteria. My mini-project consisted of a text-based trivia board game for many players, this can be shown/run easily from vs code, or it could be uploaded somewhere in a zip folder. I also have the coding logs for my lab exercises as PDFs. I now know how to use my previous coding knowledge in a java language. I have also learnt how important it is to return to topics already learnt as you may learn something new - despite knowing something very well already.

                    <h2>-------------------------------------</h2>
                    <p>In this module, I developed my willingness to learn verbal communication skills by interacting with demonstrators and peers when I found a lab exercise difficult. From the module overall, I learned more about the inner workings of the computer and another way of writing code at machine level (MIPS). By doing the lab exercises, I practised my perseverance and motivational skills. This allowed me to learn well from any mistakes and helped me gain higher marks in exams, as I had a better understanding of the topic due to the labs.The coursework was puzzling but allowed me to demonstrate my problem solving and creativity skills as I tried to code solutions for the problems given. I now know how TCP/IP works as this puzzled me in the past, accompanying this is a new knowledge of how data is transferred across networks and how the network is laid out. I have also learnt how MIPS is written and used by the computer to complete tasks.</p>

                    <h2>-------------------------------------</h2>
                    <p>This module had me utilize my willingness to learn to figure out and understand the logic concepts given throughout the semester. This module was also another source of organisation and planning skills as I had to create notes on logic in good time, to understand the problems given to me. The lab quizzes also helped me build my perseverance as they were challenging but allowed me to look to my peers and demonstrators for help, further developing my communication skills. Most of this module was new to me, which is a stark difference from the other computer-based modules this semester. I learn how to use and solve box plots with continuous practice and many references over time. I also learn about set theory and strengthened my problem-solving skills whilst doing so.</p>

                    <h2>-------------------------------------</h2>
                    <p>As this module was completely based on teamwork and team skills, I grew and developed my Teamwork, Verbal communication and Leadership skills by communicating my ideas and thoughts to the group. I believe that, when I took on the leadership role, I made sure everyone’s voices were heard and organized the work, with my organisation skills so that no one felt that they did too much or too little work. 
                        Our first assignment was to write an essay on a technology’s opportunities and constraints, here I developed my organisation and resourcefulness skills as I found and utilized data from references.
                        Our second assignment was to present a topic and PowerPoint to a group of assessors. Here, I used my leadership and verbal communication skills to help distribute work across the team
                        Our final assignment was to write a markup for a new technology, here I also used my leadership skills as well as utilised the drive and motivation to get us through the task. Now, I know a significantly larger amount about cookies due to the work we did in our first coursework. I also now know how to properly reference and credit external works that are used in mine.</p>
