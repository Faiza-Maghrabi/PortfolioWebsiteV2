                    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>Side project made with tutorial at: <a href="https://youtu.be/vyqbNFMDRGQ">https://youtu.be/vyqbNFMDRGQ</a></p>
                    <p>
                        A two-player fighting game that uses keyboard controls to control the characters. Canvas was used within JS to draw and manipulate the sprites along the screen, a gravity and animation system was coded in as well as a very basic physis engine. The UI was implemented using HTML ontop of the canvas and uses animations downloaded online.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can play the game here: <a href="https://faiza-maghrabi.github.io/fighting-game/">https://faiza-maghrabi.github.io/fighting-game/</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This project required the use of JS's canvas, many sprites and multiple classes to deal with methods called multiple times.

                        A small game that consisted of a few buttons for the user to click. When the user presses an attack button, damage is done to the monster - based on the weapon currently equipted. When the monster is defeated, the player gets money and this can be used to get new weapons that deal more damage and lets the user gain more money quicker.

                        This project includes polymorphism, inheritance, read/write methods, utilisation of multiple spirites, and interface implementation.

                    <p>A board-game-like program for multiple people. Each player rolls a random die and moves across
                        the board, they can also answer questions and this may alter their position. The first one to the 
                        end of the board wins. The game can be ended after every turn and data is saved and read from playerDetails.txt

                    <p>
                        This project required the use of multiple classes, a gameloop as well as read & write functions.

                    <p>A town simulator game I created within Visual Studio 2019. It consists of
                        a grid based town that changes as the user makes decisions on the prompts
                        that are given
                    </p>
                    <p>This project required spities, which I drew myself. This project also used the
                        data recived from my 'Text Compressor' project above to obtain the email information.
